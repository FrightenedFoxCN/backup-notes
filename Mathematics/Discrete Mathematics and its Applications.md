### Propositional calculus

**Def 1. Proposition** A declarative sentence that is either true or false, but not both. Letters like $p$ used to denote propositions are called **propositional variables** or **sentential variables**. The **truth value** of a proposition is denoted by $\mathbb{T}$ or $\mathbb{F}$. The area of logic that deals with propositions is called the **propositional calculus** or **propositional logic**.

**Def 2. Atomic propositions** Propositions that cannot be expressed in terms of simpler propositions.

**Def 3. Compound propositions** Propositions constructed by combining one or more propositions with **logical operators**.

**Def 4. Boolean variables **A variable whose value is either true or false. By replacing true and false by 1 and 0, **bit operations** can be defined as follows:

| $x$  | $y$  | $x \vee y$ | $x \wedge y$ | $x \oplus y$ |
| :--: | :--: | :--------: | :----------: | :----------: |
|  0   |  0   |     0      |      0       |      0       |
|  0   |  1   |     1      |      0       |      1       |
|  1   |  0   |     1      |      0       |      1       |
|  1   |  1   |     1      |      1       |      1       |

these operators can be extended to **bit strings**, sequences of 0's and 1's.

**Def 5. Consistency** Specifications is **consistent** if they don't contain conflicting requirements that can derive a **contradiction**.

**Def 6. Tautology, Contradiction and Contingency **A **tautology** is a compound proposition that is always true. A **contradiction** is a compound proposition that is always false. A **contingency** is a compound proposition that is neither a tautology nor a contradiction.

**Def 7. Logical equivalences** The compound proposition $p$ and $q$ are **logically equivalent** if $p \leftrightarrow q$ is a tautology, denoted by $p \equiv q$ or $p \Leftrightarrow q$.

*! in $\LaTeX$ typed with `p \equiv q` or `p \Leftrightarrow q`. Sometimes I'd prefer `p \iff q` for simplicity yet it compiles to become $p \iff q$, much longer and uglier than previous one.*

**Def 8. Satisfiability** A compound proposition is **satisfiable** if there is an assignment of truth values to its variables that makes it true (i.e. when it is a tautology or a contingency). Otherwise the compound proposition is unsatisfiable. A particular assignment of truth values to its variables to make it true is called a **solution** to this satisfiability problem.

**Def 9. Dual** The dual of a compound proposition that contains only the logical operators $\vee$, $\wedge$ and $\neg$ is the compound proposition obtained by replacing each $\vee$ by $\wedge$, each $\wedge$ by $\vee$, each $\mathbb{T}$ by $\mathbb{F}$, and each $\mathbb{F}$ by $\mathbb{T}$. The dual of $s$ is denoted by $s^*$.

### Predicate calculus

**Def 13. Predicate** The **predicate** refers to a property that the subject of the statement can have. The statement $P(x)$ is also called the value of the **propositional function** $P$ at $x$, where $P$ denotes the predicate. A statement of the form $P(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n)$ is the value of the propositional function $P$ at the $n$-tuple $(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n)$. $P$ is also called an $n$**-place predicate** or an **$n$-ary predicate**.

**Def 14. Preconditions and Postconditions** The statements that describe valid input are known as **preconditions** and the conditions that the output shoud satisfy when the program has run are known as **postconditions**.

**Def 15. Quantifiers** Quantification expresses the extend to which a predicate is true over a range of elements. The area of logic that deals whth predicates and quantifiers is called the **predicate calculus**.

**Def 16. Domain** Many statements assert that a property is true for all values of a variable in a particular domain, called the **domain of discourse**, **universe of discourse** or often just referred to as **domain**.

> **Quantifiers:**
>
> 1. the **universal quantifier** that means "for all" or "for every" is denoted by $\forall$
>
>    *! in $\LaTeX$, typed with `\forall`.*
>
> 2. the **existial quantifier** that means "there exists" is denoted by $\exists$
>
>    *! in $\LaTeX$, typed with `\exists`*
>
> 3. the **unickness quantifier** that means "there exists a unique" is denoted by $\exist!$ or $\exist_1$
>
> the quantifiers have higher precedence than all logical operators from propositional calculus.

**Th. De Morgan's Laws for Quantifiers** $\neg \exists x P(x) \equiv \forall x \neg P(x), \neg \forall x P(x) \equiv \exists x \neg P(x)$

**Table 2. Null quantification** Assuming that the domain is nonempty and $x$ does not occur as a free variable in $A$:

| $(\forall x P(x)) \vee A \equiv \forall x(P(x) \vee A), (\exists x P(x)) \vee A \equiv \exist x (P(x) \vee A)$ |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: |
| $(\forall x P(x)) \wedge A \equiv \forall x (P(x) \wedge A), (\exists x P(x)) \wedge A \equiv \exists x(P(x) \wedge A)$ |
| $\forall x(A \rightarrow P(x)) \equiv A \rightarrow \forall x P(x), \exists x (A \rightarrow P(x)) \equiv A \rightarrow \exists x P(x)$ |
| $\forall x (P(x) \rightarrow A) \equiv \exists x P(x) \rightarrow A, \exists x(P(x) \rightarrow A) \equiv \forall x P(x) \rightarrow A$ |

**Def 17. Prenex normal form (PNF)** A statement is in **prenex normal form** if and onlt if it is of the form$Q_1x_1Q_2x_2\cdots Q_kx_kP(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_k)$, where each $Q_i$ is either the existential quantifier or the universal quantifier, and $P(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_k)$ is a predicate involving no quantifiers.

**Th. **Every statement formed from propositional variables, predicates, $\mathbb{T}$, and $\mathbb{F}$ using logical connectives and quantifiers is equivalent to a statement in prenex normal form.

<TO PROVE>

### Inference & Proof

**Def 18. Argument** A sequence of statements that end with a conclusion is called an argument. All but the final proposition in the argument are called **premises** and the final proposition is called the **conclusion**. An argument is **valid** if the truth of all its premises implies that the conclusion is true.

**Def 19. Argument form** An argument form in propositional logic is a sequence of compound proposition involving propositional variables. An argument form is valid if no matter which particular propositions are substituted for the propositional variables in its premises, the conclusion is true if the premises are all true.

| $\exists x P(x) \\ \therefore P(c) \mathrm{\ for\ some\ element}\ c$ | Existential instantiation  |
| $P(c) \mathrm{\ for\ some\ element\ }c\\ \therefore \exists xP(x)$ | Existential generalization |
| $\forall x (P(x) \rightarrow Q(x)) \\ P(a), \mathrm{\ where}\ a \mathrm{\ is\ a\ particular\ element\ in\ the\ domain}\\ \therefore Q(a)$ |   Universal modus ponens   |
| $\forall x (P(x) \rightarrow Q(x)) \\ \neg Q(a), \mathrm{\ where\ } a \mathrm{\ is\ a\ particular\ element\ in\ the\ domain} \\ \therefore \neg P(a)$ |  Universal modus tollens   |
| $\forall x(P(x) \rightarrow Q(x))\\ \forall x(Q(x) \rightarrow R(x)) \\ \therefore \forall x(P(x) \rightarrow R(x))$ |   Universal transitivity   |

**Def 20. Theorem (facts / results), Propositions, Axioms (postulates), Lemma, Corollary & Conjecture** A theorem(or a fact, a result) is a statement that can be shown to be true. Less important theorems sometimes are called propositions. Axioms(or postulates) are statements we assume to be true. A lemma(Pl. lemmas or lemmata) is a less important theorem that is helpful in the proof of other results. A corollary is a theorem that can be directly established from a theorem that has been proved. A conjecture is a statement that is being proposed to be a true statement, usually on the basis of some partial evidence.

**Def 21. Direct proof & Indirect proof** A direct proof of a conditional statement $p \rightarrow q$ is constructed when the first step is the assumption that $p$ is true; subsequent steps are constructed using rules of inference, with the final step showing that $q$ must also be true. Indirect proofs are those that are not direct proofs

**Def 22. Vacuous proof** In statement $p \rightarrow q$, prove that $p$ is false.

**Def 23. Trivial proof** In statement $p \rightarrow q$, prove that $q$ is a tautology.

**Def 24. Proof by contraposition** Using the fact that $p \rightarrow q \equiv \neg q \rightarrow \neg p$, prove that its contrapositive is true.

**Def 25. Proof by contradiction** If $\neg p \rightarrow(r \wedge \neg r)$ is shown, we can prove that $p$ is true.

**Def 26. Exhaustive proof ** Preceed by exhausting all possibilities.

**Def 27. Existence proof** A proof of a proposition $\exists x P(x)$ is called an existence proof. It is called **constructive** if it's given by finding a **witness** $a$ that $P(a)$, and non-constructive otherwise.

### Sets

**Def 1. Set** A set is an unordered collection of distinct objects, called **elements** or **members** of the set. A set is called to **contain** its elements, denoted $a \in A$ *! in $\LaTeX$, typed with `a \in A`*. Ways to describe a set: **roster method, set builder notation**.

**Def 2. Greedy algorithm** Algorithms that make what seems to be the best choice at each step are called greedy algorithms.

**Th. Halting problem** There is no procedure that takes as input a program and input and determines whether the program will eventually stop when run with this input.

> **Pf.** Assume that there is a procedure called $H(P, I)$ that can do such thing, taking as input procedure $P$ and input $I$. We construct a simple procedure $K(P)$, which does the opposite of what the output $H(P, P)$ specifies. If the output of $H(K, K)$ is "loops forever", then $K(K)$ halts, vise versa. Here comes the contradiction.
