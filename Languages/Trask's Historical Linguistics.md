- Middle English, from Chaucer's *Treatise of the astrolabe*

  > Lyte Lowys my sone, I aperceyve wel by certeyne evidences thyn abilite to lerne sciences touching nombres and proportions; and as wel consider I thy besy praier in special to lerne the tretys of the Astrelabie. Than for as mochel as a philosofre saith, ‘he wrappith him in his frend, that condescendith to the rightfulle praiers of his frend,’ therefore have I yeven the a suffi sant Astrolabie as for oure orizonte, compowned after the latitude of Oxenforde; upon which, by mediacioun of this litel tretys, I purpose to teche the a certain nombre of conclusions aperteynyng to the same instrument.

- Modern English, a letter by Jonathan Swift, in 1712

  > MY LORD, I do here, in the Name of all the Learned and Polite Perʃons of the Nation, complain to your LORDSHIP, as Firʃt Miniʃter, that our Language is extremely imperfect; that its daily Improvements are by no means in proportion to its daily Corruptions; that the Pretenders to poliʃh and refi ne it, have chiefl y multiplied Abuʃes and Abʃurdities; and, that in many Inʃtances, it offends againʃt every Part of Grammar. I ʃee no abʃolute Neceʃʃity why any Language ʃhould be perpetually changing;
  >
  > BUT what I have moʃt at Heart is, that ʃome Method ʃhould be thought on for aʃcertaining and fi xing our Language for ever, after ʃuch Alterations are made in it as ʃhall be thought requiʃite. For I am of Opinion, that it is better a Language ʃhould not be wholly perfect, than that it ʃhould be perpetually changing; and we muʃt give over at one Time, or at length infallibly change for the worʃe:
  >
  > BUT where I ʃay, that I would have our Language, after it is duly correct, always to laʃt; I do not mean that it ʃhould never be enlarged: Provided, that no Word which a Society ʃhall give a Sanction to, be afterwards antiquated and exploded, they may have liberty to receive whatever new ones they ʃhall fi nd occaʃion for:

- orthographic peculiarities and punctuation were fashion of the day

nouns more often than verbs & adjectives

> **E.g. Turkish from Arabic**
>
> - unable to borrow directly (different declenation)
>
>   Arabic verb - root consisting entirely consist of consonants
>
>   *ktb* write -> *katab* he writes, *kutib* it was written, *aktub* he's writing
>
>   while Turkish verb includes at least one vowel (*yaz-* write -> *yazdi* he wrote, *yazildi* it was writen, *yaziyor* he's writing)

> Eng. genre fr. Fre. trying to approximating to the French pronunciation
>
> Eng. muesli fr. Ger.  with English sounds throughout

the first option sometimes brings about changes in phonological system

> **E. g. case of Eng. /v/**

> - very, vine, vicar, vinegar ... fr. Fr.
> - for contrast between few - view, fine - vine ...
> - having contrast in all positions

>
> - Fre. /y/, front rounded vowel
>
> - replaced by /ju:/ in Eng.
>
> - following /z/ in Fre. words, becoming /zju:/ or /zy/ in Fre.
>
>   leisure, azure, pleasure, ...
>
> - /z/ merge with /j/ to produce fractive /ʒ/
>
> - ongoing process 
>
> *Also:* /ŋ/ fr. Eng. to Fre., combination /ʃt-/, /ʃl-/, /ʃm-/ initial fr. Ger. to Eng.

#### Morphological treatment
